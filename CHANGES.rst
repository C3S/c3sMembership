  commits.

- Code cleanup

  - accountants_view.py

  - views.py

- Integrate the deform TextInputSliderWidget so that it doesn't need

  application.

- Fix several German typos like "Nachnahme" instead of "Nachname", "Email"
  instead of "E-Mail" and "Addresse" instead of "Adresse".

  text, therefore not compatible with .pt internationalization and causing 
  parsing errors.

  is now CHANGES.rst.

  to show the C3S website in the corresponding language.

  formular.

  a wrong jQuery path would not allow deletions without confirmation dialog
  in the future.

  corrected all references.

1.10.1
======


- Remove column "BC/GV" from Application for Membership dashboard. Emails
  were sent without confirmation when clicking the button.

- Introduce version number to c3sMembership. Start with 1.10.1. The
  application has been productively used for some time (i.e. at least 1.0)
  and went through a few changes since then. Therefore, taking 1.10.0 for
  the existing version 1.10.0 seems reasonable.
