  commits.

  - accountants_view.py

  - views.py

- Integrate the deform TextInputSliderWidget so that it doesn't need

  to show the C3S website in the corresponding language.

1.10.1
======


- Remove column "BC/GV" from Application for Membership dashboard. Emails
  were sent without confirmation when clicking the button.

- Introduce version number to c3sMembership. Start with 1.10.1. The
  application has been productively used for some time (i.e. at least 1.0)
  and went through a few changes since then. Therefore, taking 1.10.0 for
  the existing version 1.10.0 seems reasonable.
