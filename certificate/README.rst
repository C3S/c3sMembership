C3S-certificate
---------------

This repository holds 'private' files for membership certificate generation
in the c3sMembership webapp @ https://yes.c3s.cc.

Private means non-public -- files we don't want to go into a public repository,
because this would enable anyone to create our very own certificates.

The contents of this folder (certificates/) have to be replaced by something
meaningful from one of our private repositories. Sorry.
