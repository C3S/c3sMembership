c3sMembership README
====================

This Pyramid app handles membership for C3S SCE
(Cultural Commons Collecting Society SCE mit beschr√§nkter Haftung.

The app that once started as a form to gain new members has
grown to a membership administration system catering to the needs of a
growing european cooperative (C3S SCE) with around 1000 members as of now.

Some features:

* Internationalisation (i18n)
* Membership information is persisted in a database.
* GnuPG encrypted mail with details submitted is sent to C3S staff.
* Once the email is verified, form submission data is used to populate a pdf with form fields
  (using fdf and pdftk) and the resulting PDF is ready for download.
* Membership certificates (pdflatex)
* Membership Dues (pdflatex)
