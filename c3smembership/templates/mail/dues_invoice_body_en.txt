Hello {salutation},

On June 2, 2019, the sixth ordinary general assembly of the C3S extended the
temporary membership dues regulations. It still provides for membership dues
for full members in order to cover our operating costs.

For 2020, the annual membership dues for full members are therefore 50 Euro.
The amount is less if you joined later than in the first quarter 2020.

Please transfer {dues_amount} Euro to the following account of the C3S SCE:

  Purpose: {invoice_number}, member no. {membership_number}
  IBAN: DE79 8309 4495 0003 2643 78
  BIC: GENODEF1ETK
  Bank: Ethikbank

In order to enable the proper allocation of your membership dues, please
add the above-mentioned purpose.

You will find the invoice here:
