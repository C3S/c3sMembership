Hello {salutation},

On April 17th, 2016, the 3. regular general assembly of the C3S has
again issued temporary membership contribution rules, in order to secure 
the financial basis for the continuation of our common project:

For 2016, the annual membership dues for active members will therefore
be 50 Euro. They will be less if you joined later than in the first
quarter 2016 (12,50 Euro per quarter of active membership).

Please transfer {dues_amount} Euro to the following account of the C3S SCE:

  Purpose: {invoice_number}, member no. {membership_number}
  IBAN: DE79 8309 4495 0003 2643 78
  BIC: GENODEF1ETK
  Bank: Ethikbank

In order to enable the proper allocation of your membership dues, please
add the above-mentioned purpose.

You will find the invoice here:
