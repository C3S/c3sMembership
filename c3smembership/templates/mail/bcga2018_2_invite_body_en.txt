Hello {salutation},

the administrative board of the

Cultural Commons Collecting Society SCE
mit beschränkter Haftung
- C3S SCE -
Rochusstr. 44
40479 Düsseldorf

invites you

to the 2nd exceptional general assembly of the C3S SCE on December 1,
2018.

Location:         Rochusstr. 44
                  40479 Düsseldorf [2]
Time:             1.00 pm - 4.00 pm
                  Accreditation from 12.00 pm

Please confirm your participation by mailing back to office@c3s.cc.


Background for having this extraordinary general assembly is that we
need to make up for the postponed topics of the general assembly in
June.

Adding to that, we'd like to present the latest draft of changes to
our statutes. It includes all the feedback we got from the DPMA
regarding our approval as a collecting society. Some rather critical
details, like the inclusion of derivative reightowners, yet need to be
discussed.

Because of organizational reasons, we want to extend the contribution
rules so that we could charge for them already in January rather than
in July.  This will make budget planning much more easier for us.

Organizational Issues
=====================

Participation
-------------
Participation in the general assembly is limited to members of the C3S
SCE or authorized representatives of absent members.

Authorized representatives
--------------------------------
If you are an active member and therefore entitled to vote, but unable
to participate, you may grant a power of attorney. Further information
on that will be included in the registration e-mail.

Please note that every representative may only represent two members.
If in doubt, please ask the representative for other persons already
represented by the representative. Powers of attorney have to be
presented as written original; fax or scan copies are not admissible.

According to § 13 (6) 3 of our statute, representatives may be only
members of the cooperative, spouse, parents, children, or siblings of
a member.  Registered partners are treated like spouses.

Please remember that the representative has to take the power of
attorney to the meeting and to present it to the chairman of the
meeting.

Audio Recording

During the general assembly, an audio recording will be made in order
to ensure error-free minutes. The recording will not be published but
archived internally as an appendix to the minutes.

Those who do not wish their speech contributions to be recorded, may
veto before commencing to speak.


Why is it Important that You Participate?

The general assembly is the body that takes the fundamental decisions
for the C3S. (You are the general assembly, together with the other
members.)

That's all! Please let us know your proposals for topics, plan your
trip - and we'll meet in Düsseldorf in December! If you have
questions, you can get in touch, as always, via info@c3s.cc.

We look forward to you and your ideas!
