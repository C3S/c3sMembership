Event Location
====================

The general assemblies and the barcamp will be held in Düsseldorf
in the building where we also have our office:

                 Rochusstr. 44
                 40479 Düsseldorf [2]

Please be punctual in order to avoid delays, because the accreditation
will take some time. Of course, participation is free.


Dates of the Events
===================

01.06.2019: Barcamp 1pm - 7pm MEST [3]
02.06.2019: 6th Statutory General Assembly 1pm - 5pm CEST
23.06.2019: 3rd Exceptional General Assembly 1pm - 5pm CEST
            Accreditation from 12.00 pm
            Admission free


The General Assemblies
======================

The background for our invitation to two General Assemblies is that
we want to resolve amendments to the statutes. For a statute change,
half of all cooperative members have to be present at the General
Assembly. If less than half of the members are present, the General
Assembly cannot decide upon the statute amendments, and it has to
be dealt with at another General Assembly, which has to be convoked
just for this purpose and the member quorum won't apply then. Since
we are assuming that there will be less than half of the members at
the first general assembly, we are already inviting you to the
second General Assembly.

Although we will not be able to vote on the statutes in the first
general meeting (item 6 on the agenda), we will of course inform
about and discuss the current developments of our dialogue with the
DPMA, so that opinions from the first general assembly will have an
effect in the second general assembly as well.

In retrospect, the process with the DPMA took much longer than
expected, and we had to compromise. However, we believe that we have
managed the balancing act between our ideals and the legal
requirements quite well and that we have met a core requirement
for approval with the new version of the statutes.

An important item on the agenda on June 2 will also be the
re-election of the Board of Directors, as the term of office of the
old one ends this year.


The Barcamp
===========

Again, we expect that there will be the need for further information
and discussion on some topics, which we cannot meet in the general
assembly.  In order to prepare the general assembly and to move up
debates, we are offering a barcamp [3], where half a day is devoted
to discussions and idea exchange in parallel time slots.

First, we will collect suggestions for topics, then determine which
topics are of sufficient interest and arrange them in time, so that
there are as few personal overlaps as possible. The goal is to produce
short and comprehensible summaries of what has been discussed at the
barcamp.

Organizational issues
=====================

Participation
-------------
Participation in the general assembly is limited to members of the
C3S SCE or authorized representatives of absent members.

Authorized representatives
--------------------------------
If you are an active member and therefore entitled to vote, but unable
to participate, you may grant a power of attorney. Agents may represent
a maximum of two members and must be either a member of the cooperative
or your spouse, parent, child or sibling. The power of attorney must be
submitted signed on paper at the accreditation.
Forms for the power of attorney can be found here:
- for ordinary members: https://url.c3s.cc/auprivater
- for investing members: https://url.c3s.cc/auprivatei
- for companies & associations: https://url.c3s.cc/aucorporate

Audio recording
---------------
During the general assembly, an audio recording will be made in order
to ensure error-free minutes. The recording will not be published but
archived internally as an appendix to the minutes.

Those who do not wish their speech contributions to be recorded may
veto before commencing to speak.


Why is it important that you participate?
=========================================

At the barcamp, you will be able to make detailed contributions to the
discussions of the current topics and talk to the core team of the C3S.
The general assembly is the body that takes the fundamental decisions
for the C3S. (You are the general assembly, together with the other
members.)

That's all! Please let us know your proposals for topics, plan your
trip - and we'll meet in Düsseldorf in June! If you have questions,
you can get in touch, as always, via info@c3s.cc.

We look forward to you and your ideas!
