Please let us know whether you will participate. We must know in advance
whether the location will be large enough. Therefore please respond by 
April 4th, 2016, at the latest.

On the linked page you can confirm your participation in the General
Assembly and the BarCamp separately. You can also book a meal for the

Authorized representatives
---------------------------
If you are a regular member and therefore entitled to vote, but unable 
to participate, you may grant a power of attorney:

Please bear in mind that every authorized representative is able to represent 
two members only via power of attorney. Therefore make sure to ask whether the 
person you want to authorize already represents other members. For legal 
reasons power of attorney must be granted in writing and in the original; 
FAX or scanned documents are not sufficient!

According to § 13 (6), sentence 3 of the articles of association, only members 
of the cooperative society, or spouses, parents, children or siblings of a 
member, are entitled to be representatives with voting rights. Registered 
civil partners are treated as spouses. When you cancel your participation 
using the above given link you may name your representative online.

Please remember that your representative must bring the written power of 
attorney, signed by you. 

Investor members who are not entitled to vote may also be represented by 
others. Here you can find a form:
Individuals (investor members): http://url.c3s.cc/auprivateI
Companies and organizations: http://url.c3s.cc/aucorporate

That's all! Let us know your proposals for topics [1], plan your trip -- 
and we shall meet in Düsseldorf! If you have questions, you can get
in touch, as always, via info@c3s.cc.

We are looking forward to seeing you and learning your ideas!
