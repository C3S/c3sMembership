Hello {salutation},

On June 28, 2020, the seventh ordinary general assembly of the C3S extended the
temporary membership dues regulations. It still provides for membership dues
for full members in order to cover our operating costs.

For 2021, the membership dues for active members will therefore be 50
Euro.

Since you are an investing member, you are exempt from this payment.
However, your voluntary contribution would be highly appreciated as a
tremendous help for the C3S.

If you want to support us, please transfer your voluntary contribution
to the following account:

  Purpose: C3S-FZ-{membership_number}
  IBAN: DE79 8309 4495 0003 2643 78
  BIC: GENODEF1ETK
  Bank: Ethikbank

Many thanks for your support!

Your C3S team
